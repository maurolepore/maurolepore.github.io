My official title is "IT specialist - R-package developer". In practice, I build software, learn best practices in data science, and share ideas and resources with researchers and higher-education students to help them work in an efficient, transparent, and reproducible way. I spend most of my time building R packages or teaching R, Git, GitHub, sometimes in person but mostly remotely.
