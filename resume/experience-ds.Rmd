My official title is "IT specialist - R-package developer". I implement software solutions to help researchers work in an efficient, transparent, and reproducible way. I develop new software (R packages) and update a legacy code base. I also teach data science skills (e.g. R, Git, GitHub) to researchers and students, and help them troubleshoot, both remotely and in person.
