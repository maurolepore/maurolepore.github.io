### The University of Queensland, Australia

PhD in ecology, environmental sciences, and geochemistry  
2011-2015  
School of Biological Sciences, ARC Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies  

Thesis: "Long term dynamics of coral reefs in the inshore southern Great Barrier Reef".

I examined three issues:

1. The potential of a reef system  to constitute a refuge  for coral reefs from global warming.
2. The accretion rate of the  reef flat and reef  slope environment through time.
3. Changes in coral community structure through time, and the mechanisms of  community assembly.

In the field and lab, I supervised three students and 20 volunteers.
