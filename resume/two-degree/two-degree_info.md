Dear fellow fighters of climate change,

I’m very interested in your [open position for a software developer with
R](https://www.r-users.com/jobs/software-developer-with-r/). I would
love to use my experience to help you fight climate change.

Here is how my skills match what you are looking for:

> A R Coder/Software Developer who is passionate about having a
> meaningful, global impact

  - **I am an R software developer**. I work at the [Smithsonian
    Institution](https://forestgeo.si.edu) for a global network of
    researchers who aim to better **understand and predict forest
    dynamics in the face of climate**. (Unfortunately, the available
    funds will run out soon so I am seeking new opportunities.)

  - My passion for having a meaningful, global impact is demonstrated by
    one chapter of my **[PhD
    thesis](http://bit.ly/mauro-lepore-phd-thesis)** (Chapter 2)
    exploring the potential of a coral reef system to constitute a
    **refuge for corals from global warming**. Also by **[this
    paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cobi.12997)**
    exploring how **historical data can help us make better conservation
    decisions**.

> Genuine interest to improve our code/software infrastructure and
> related services

  - In my current role, I developed **experience improving legacy code
    and related software infrastructure and services**. I would love to
    use my skills to help the 2° Investing Initiative align financial
    markets with climate goals. For example, I **created a [GitHub
    organization](https://github.com/forestgeo)** with multiple
    repositories, transformed legacy code from [a collection of
    functions](http://ctfs.si.edu/Public/CTFSRPackage/) to **[a
    collection of R packages](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/)**
    *sensu stricto*. I also created a
    **[blog](https://fgeo.netlify.com)**, an internal **slack work
    space**, **tutorials** (see [Tutorials
    tab](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/)), and a **custom [CRAN-like
    repository](https://forestgeo.github.io/drat/)** to manage and serve
    the release of internal packages.

> Experience in library creation including application of continuous
> integration services to ensure code quality

I have two years of **experience as a developer of [R
libraries](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/index.html#installation)**,
using best practices including the application of [continuous
integration](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo). For example, for my
current employer I built four main packages (a.k.a. libraries) and a
meta-package that installs them all with a single R command
([fgeo](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo)). They are well tested (e.g.
[here](https://coveralls.io/github/forestgeo/fgeo.tool), and
[here](https://coveralls.io/github/forestgeo/fgeo.analyze)), and
connected to a **[continuous integration
service](https://travis-ci.org/forestge)** so that every change
**automatically builds, checks and deploys each packages and its
associated website.**

> Strong R skills (3+ years’ experience in software development with R
> in a working context), proficiency with git

I am a **proficient with
[Git](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yeti01v9mcj9s71/2018-11-05_git.pdf?dl=0)**;
over the past year I have **[pushed to GitHub over 5500
commits](https://github.com/maurolepore)**.

My total practical experience as an R software developer is about three
years. However, the first year in my current role was somewhat informal
and I officially earned the title “R package developer” about two years
ago. Overall, I have about **five years of experience working with R
almost every day**. Beyond my paid work, I regularly [contribute to the
R community](http://bit.ly/mauro-lepore-about).

> A pro-active problem-solver with strong analytical skills and a good
> sense for code quality

  - I **solve problems pro-actively** every day. In my current role I am
    the only software developer. I find solutions **independently**,
    often in books, blogs or by asking other R developers online (I
    reach excellent R developers at the private slack work space of
    [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/)).

  - I developed strong **analytical skills during my PhD and postdoc**.

  - I developed a good sense for **code quality via workshops** (e.g.
    [Building Tidy
    Tools](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/04/09/building-tidy-tools-workshop/)),
    and **books** (e.g. [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/), [The
    pragmatic
    programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer),
    [Code
    complete](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670),
    [Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html),
    etc.).

> Further technical expertise, such as web development, data
> visualisation, GUI development (e.g. with RShiny) as well as
> experience with SQL and Docker is very welcome

I have **experience building** [**websites** for R
packages](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/)),
[blogs](https://fgeo.netlify.com), [**RShiny
apps**](https://maurolepore.shinyapps.io/plottrait/). I also have some
experience with **SQL queries**.

> Fluent English

  - I am very **fluent** in English. **Lived in English speaking
    countries for almost 10 years** now. I did a PhD in Australia and
    now work in the US.

I look forward to meeting you soon. I would love learn more about your
mission and further discuss how I can contribute to it. I am happy to
negotiate the earliest possible starting date.

Best regards,  
Mauro

A global, independent think tank on the integration of long-term and
climate-related objectives and risks into financial market metrics,
processes and regulation.

Since it was set up in 2012 with the mission to align financial markets
with climate goals, the 2° Investing Initiative (2°ii) has become a
pioneering think tank – with offices in Berlin, Paris, London and New
York – on the integration of long-term risks and policy objectives into
financial markets and regulatory frameworks. 2°ii developed the first
scenario analysis tool linking financial portfolios to public policy
objectives – specifically the 2°C climate goal – which is now applied to
over $10 trillion assets under management across more than 1,000
financial institutions, as well as a number of financial supervisors.
2°ii co-designed the first climate-related financial regulation in the
world (Art. 173 of the French Energy Transition Law). A core principle
of its mission is to reduce the transaction costs across companies,
financial institutions and policymakers, while guiding financial markets
towards the long-term future.

Current research includes development of climate alignment tools for
banks, market outlook reports and enhancement of existing, analytical
methods as well as a sustainability-ready, open-source robo-adviser.
2°ii has a multi-stakeholder and independent governance framework
designed to ensure the intellectual integrity of its work and its
independence.
