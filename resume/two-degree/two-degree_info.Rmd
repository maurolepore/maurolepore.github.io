A global, independent think tank on the integration of long-term and climate-related objectives and risks into financial market metrics, processes and regulation.

Since it was set up in 2012 with the mission to align financial markets with climate goals, the 2° Investing Initiative (2°ii) has become a pioneering think tank – with offices in Berlin, Paris, London and New York – on the integration of long-term risks and policy objectives into financial markets and regulatory frameworks. 2°ii developed the first scenario analysis tool linking financial portfolios to public policy objectives – specifically the 2°C climate goal – which is now applied to over $10 trillion assets under management across more than 1,000 financial institutions, as well as a number of financial supervisors. 2°ii co-designed the first climate-related financial regulation in the world (Art. 173 of the French Energy Transition Law). A core principle of its mission is to reduce the transaction costs across companies, financial institutions and policymakers, while guiding financial markets towards the long-term future.

Current research includes development of climate alignment tools for banks, market outlook reports and enhancement of existing, analytical methods as well as a sustainability-ready, open-source robo-adviser. 2°ii has a multi-stakeholder and independent governance framework designed to ensure the intellectual integrity of its work and its independence.
