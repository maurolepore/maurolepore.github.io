Dear HR team at Rice University and The Kinder Institute for Urban
Research,

I am an R programmer with experience doing doctoral and postdoctoral
research in ecology, a field with a strong focus on data management and
statistical analysis. Below I detail how my skills match what you are
looking for:

  - I have a PhD from a top university in Australia.
  - I have five years of experience programming and managing data using
    R.
  - I know statistical packages in R well. I used them for my own
    research.
  - I published a number of papers in peer-reviewed journals. This
    helped me to develop excellent analytical and research skills, and
    the ability to write and proofread complex documents.
  - I also presented talks at a number of academic conferences. This
    helped me to develop excellent verbal and presentation skills.
  - My main ongoing project proves my ability to write clear and concise
    technical documentation (e.g.
    <https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/articles/siteonly/reference.html>).
  - I am highly skilled in R programming, and very willing to learn
    Python, STATA or other programming languages as needed. I haven’t
    used SAS before but, based on my ability learning other programming
    languages and environments, I’m confident I could learn quickly.
  - Part of my current role is to help researchers and students work in
    an efficient, transparent, and reproducible way. Thus I have
    experience collaborating with people whose skills and expertise
    differ widely. Beyond my paid work, I also do this as a certified
    instructor for The Carpentries, an organization that teaches
    foundation data skills to researchers. By doing this, I developed
    empathy and excellent interpersonal skills.
  - In my role as an R software programmer I solve technical problems on
    multiple projects every day. I use the best practices for efficient
    management of software projects.
  - I am very comfortable with the MS Office Suite. I have used multiple
    products for many years now.

I look forward to a personal meeting to further discuss how I can use my
experience and skills to support The Kinder Institute for Urban
Research.

Kind regards,  
Mauro Lepore, PhD
