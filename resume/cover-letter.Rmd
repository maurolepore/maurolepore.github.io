I am very familiar with RStudio's products. I use the RStudio IDE and multiple packages by RStudio everyday. I'm also familiar with RStudio people, philosophy, events, and workshops. In fact, I am in debt. Funded by an RStudio diversity scholarship I attended rstudio::conf() 2019 and the workshop What They Forgot to Teach You About R. And with an academic discount from RStudio I attended the workshop Building Tidy Tools in 2018. In short, I would love to join RStudio to ensure your customers are wildly successful with your products.




Dear Tonya Filz,



I am ...

I believe I have the skills and experience you need from a [Customer Success Representative](https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/rstudiocom/view/P_AAAAAACAAJZPJ1EPP3oDOq?trackingTag=community):

* As a wedding photographer, learned to built trusted relationships and a deep understanding of my customers' needs. I also learned to be a good problem-solver in stressful conditions, and patient with difficult customers. And as a tourists photographer, who earned only commissions, I learned to value sales.

TODO Teacher

* During my PhD I discovered R, which was my only tool for statistics and all things data science. Eventually I became passionate about R programming, and RStudio products were largely responsible for my joy. 

* I'm curious and keen to continuously learn better ways to do data science, and I'll be excited to work in humble, empathetic, and collaborative teams -- which in academia seem rare.

* I look forward to working in a distributed team, as such teams are likely to attracts those who are the best, not just those who are willing to live in a given area. I am convinced I can function effectively that way. The last year of my PhD I worked from home to minimize distractions, and I accomplished the deepest, most productive work of my life.

I hope my resume conveys the value I could bring to RStudio. And I look forward to meeting you and, regardless the outcome, to thanking you for how much value RStudio has already brought to my life.

TODO. Heard that interviewing with RStudio can be very valuable in and on itself and I look forward to it.


TOD VISAS

Sincerely,
