I am not available for immediate hire but I am considering offers for the near future. I strongly prefer to work remotely within USA or from Houston, TX. The first three yeras of my current H1B visa expire on 2020-04-30. It can be transferred and extended for another three years. Alternatively, I am open so green card sponsorship.
