I am an ecologist turned software engineer and data science consultant. I now work for a network of forest ecologists. I develop R packages, continuously learn data science best-practices, and passionately share resources with the higher-education students and researchers I support. My goal is to help them work in an efficient and reproducible way, and to ensure they successfully use the available open source tools, including the custom packages I build for them.

I created and maintain a number of R packages now hosted on GitHub and CRAN. I contribute to popular open software projects and communities including RStudio community, the tidyverse,  rOpenSci and The Carpentries (<http://bit.ly/mauro-lepore-about>).
