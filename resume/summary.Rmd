I am an ecologist turned software engineer and data science consultant. I now work for a network of forest ecologists, building R packages and passionately sharing resources with the researchers and students I support. My goal is to help them work in an efficient and reproducible way, and to ensure they successfully use available open source tools, including the packages I build for them.

Most of my products are publicly available on GitHub or CRAN. I contribute to popular open software projects such as the tidyverse, and I am an active member of RStudio community, rOpenSci, The Carpentries, R-Ladies, and more (<http://bit.ly/mauro-lepore-about>).
