I am an _R software developer_ with interest and _experience_ working towards _fighting climate change_. I now work at the Smithsonian Institution (Washington DC, US), building R packages for a global network of researchers whose mission is to better understand and predict forest dynamics in the face of climate change. My most recent work include data-driven research (a postdoc in Panama; PhD in Australia) exploring changes in coral reefs through time, with a focus on human impacts including global warming.
