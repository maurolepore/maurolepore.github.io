I am an __R software developer__ with __experience on climate change research__. I now work at the Smithsonian Institution (Washington DC, US), building R packages for a global network of researchers whose mission is to better understand and predict forest dynamics in the face of climate change. Before, I did doctoral and postdoctoral research on the dynamics of coral reefs through time, with a focus on human impacts including global warming.
