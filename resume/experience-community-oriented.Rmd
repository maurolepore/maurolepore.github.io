### Comunity service (life guard)

Municipalidad del Partido de la Costa  
1999 - 2010  
Santa Teresita, Buenos Aires, Argentina  

For about a decade I spent my summers working as a life guard. On this job I learned the importance of community service. I also learned to invest in strong relationships with my colleagues, to ask for help, and to be reliable.
