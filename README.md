Hi, I'm Mauro Lepore, R package developer at [CTFS-ForestGEO](https://twitter.com/ForestGEO) (The Center for Tropical Forest Science - Forest Global Earth Observatory). I am interested in getting more by getting along with people, pragmatism, scientific storytelling, GitHub and R.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mauro_lepore), working with cool people in Panama and Washington DC, visiting friends and family in Argentina, running or surfing.

``` r
maurolepore <- maurolepore %>% 
  grow_up(in = "Buenos Aires, Argentina") %>% 
  undergrad(in = "biology", at = "University of Buenos Aires, Argentina") %>% 
  phd(in = "ecology", at = "University of Queensland, Australia")
  postdoc(in = "marine palaeoecology", 
    at = "Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama")
  work_now(as = "R Package Developer", at = "ForestGEO-CTFS", 
    url = "http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/") %>% 
  chase_waves(when = "always")
```

Surfing is harder than science and software development. I grew up in Buenos Aires, far from the ocean. To chase waves, I first become a lifeguard. I then surfed every summer for 12 years, but my surfing was still poor. So I studied biology and then did a PhD in marine ecology in Australia. There, I surfed every week for over 4 years; my surfing improved but not much. Next I did a postdoc in Panama and catched a some more waves. Because my progress is slower surfing than developing software, I now write R programs for [CTFS-ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/). So this is me, a guy from a busy city who became an ecologist and software developer because surfing is too hard.
