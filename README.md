About
=====

Based at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, I maintain computer programs that help ecologists to analyse the diversity and dynamics of forests around the world. I belong to the Center for Tropical Forest Science and Forest Global Earth Observations ([CTFS-ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/)).

I first joined the Smithsonian in 2016 and researched how coral reefs in Bocas del Toro, Panama, have changed over the past 7,000 years in response to human impacts. Before that I did a PhD in ecology (2015) at the University of Queensland, Australia, and a bachelors in marine biology (2008) at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
