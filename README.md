If surfing was easier, I would have gotten sick of the waves before becoming an ecologist and software developer. I grew up in Buenos Aires, far from the sea. To go surfing, I first become a lifeguard, and managed to surf every summer for 12 years. Yet, my surfing was poor so I studied biology and did a PhD in marine ecology in Australia. There, I surfed every week for over 4 years. My surfing improved but continued to be quite poor. Next I did a postdoc in Panama, and now I'm a software developer for ForestGEO-CTFS. In short, I am an ecologist and software developer because surfing is too hard.
